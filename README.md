## Setting up your Dev Environment

For comprehensive setup instructions including prerequisites, environment variables, deployment information, and troubleshooting, please see the **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** guide.

### Quick Start
This project uses Visual Studio Code Dev Containers for the easiest setup experience:

1. Install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension pack in VS Code
2. Clone this repository and open in VS Code  
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. The dev container will automatically set up everything and start the services
5. Access the app at http://localhost:5173

### Manual Commands
If you need to control the services manually:

- `./scripts/start.sh` - Start both development servers
- `./scripts/stop.sh` - Stop all running services  
- `python scripts/start_api.py` - Start only the API server (with debugger)
- `cd web && npm run dev` - Start only the web server

The API runs on port 8000 (debugger on 5678) and the web app on port 5173.
